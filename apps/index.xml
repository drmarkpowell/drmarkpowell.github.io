<p>Vid Diva is an app that can not only act as a place to keep track of movies and TV shows that you want to watch, but will also alert you when new episodes are available as well. Tell Vid Diva that you’re interested in ‘Ted Lasso’ and you’ll be notified when a new episode is ready to be watched — so you’ll never miss an episode of your favorite show again.</p>
<h2 id="see-it-on-opening-weekend">See it on opening weekend</h2>
<p>Movies more your bag? Vid Diva tracks those too! It’ll even give you a heads-up when movies reach cinemas so you can be the first in line for the very best seats in the house—all from the comfort of your iPhone.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="follow-your-favorites-free">Follow your favorites, free</h2>
<p>Vid Diva is free to use for up to 5 shows and movies. Vid Diva Premium allows for an unlimited number of shows and movies to be followed simultaneously and is available as a one-time in-app purchase.</p>
<h2 id="your-data-is-yours">Your data is yours</h2>
<p>Other tracking apps ask to track you in return—collecting and selling your data.  If that’s as big of a bummer to you as it is to me, you might appreciate this app. Vid Diva does not require an account to use and keeps your data private.</p>
