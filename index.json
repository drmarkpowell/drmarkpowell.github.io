[{"content":"Here\u0026rsquo;s another great puzzle to code a solution for.\nThis week\u0026rsquo;s puzzle from NPR:\nThis week\u0026rsquo;s challenge is a spinoff of my on-air puzzle. Name two countries that have consonyms that are nationalities of other countries. In each case, the consonants in the name of the country are the same consonants in the same order as those in the nationality of another country. No extra consonants can appear in either name. The letter Y isn\u0026rsquo;t used.\nSo if you remove all the vowels, the name of a country will equal the name of a nationality from a different country. Also, for our purposes a letter Y can be considered a vowel (ignored). Sounds good!\nInternet of Trivia Things A convenient list of all countries can be found here\n\u0026hellip;and a list of nationalities here\nTo the Swift! Here\u0026rsquo;s my solution:\nfunc doPuzzle() async throws { let countriesUrl = Bundle.main.url(forResource: \u0026#34;countries\u0026#34;, withExtension: \u0026#34;txt\u0026#34;) let countryNames = countriesUrl!.lines var countriesNoVowels: [String: String] = [:] for try await name in countryNames { let noVowels = name.lowercased() .filter({ notAVowel($0) }) .map({ \u0026#34;\\($0)\u0026#34; }) .reduce(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, +) countriesNoVowels[noVowels] = name } let nationalitiesUrl = Bundle.main.url(forResource: \u0026#34;nationalities\u0026#34;, withExtension: \u0026#34;txt\u0026#34;) let nationalityNames = nationalitiesUrl!.lines var nationalitiesNoVowels: [String: String] = [:] for try await name in nationalityNames { let noVowels = name.lowercased() .filter({ notAVowel($0) }) .map({ \u0026#34;\\($0)\u0026#34; }) .reduce(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, +) nationalitiesNoVowels[noVowels] = name } var countriesNoVowelsSet: Set\u0026lt;String\u0026gt; = [] countriesNoVowels.keys.forEach { countriesNoVowelsSet.insert($0) } nationalitiesNoVowels.keys.forEach { if countriesNoVowelsSet.contains($0) { print(\u0026#34;Match! \\(countriesNoVowels[$0]!) \\(nationalitiesNoVowels[$0]!)\u0026#34;) } } } func notAVowel(_ character: Character) -\u0026gt; Bool { character != \u0026#34;a\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; character != \u0026#34;e\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; character != \u0026#34;i\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; character != \u0026#34;o\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; character != \u0026#34;u\u0026#34; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; character != \u0026#34;y\u0026#34; } The beauty of Swift\u0026rsquo;s string implementation lets us iterate over each character of the name of a country or a nationality with a function like map or filter. As we need to remove the vowels and keep only consonants, a call to filter handles that aspect of the work, leaving us with a character. Following that, a call to map* to transform the character to string, and reduce to combine all of those single-character strings together, and we have our consonants-only names. Making these names the key values of a dictionary allows us to map them back to their original country or nationality name.\nThe Need? for Speed To keep things snappy, I also build a Set of vowel-less country names so that I can call .contains(_: String) on that for each nationality to check for a match. As it states in the Apple docs, when the elements are Hashable, the performance of a contains check is O(1), so it\u0026rsquo;s extremely fast. Although I may be guilty of premature optimization for this small data set, let\u0026rsquo;s just chalk this one up to sticking with best practices, shall we? ;)\nOne out of Two Ain\u0026rsquo;t Bad (Also Spoilers) So unfortunately with these data sources, we have no association between country and nationality, so we can\u0026rsquo;t automatically reject matches from the same country like Germany and German. However, if we allow our eyes to fall immediately to the end of the list of matches we see:\nMatch! Lebanon Albanian\n\u0026hellip;which is great! This was indeed one of the accepted answers.\nNow if you look ahead to next week\u0026rsquo;s puzzle for this accepted answer, you can also see that there was a second solution that we didn\u0026rsquo;t see!\nUkraine \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; Korean\nWhich is a shame because the puzzle stated that the solver needed to find both. The reason why our code didn\u0026rsquo;t find this answer was because in our nationalities file we have entries for\nNorth Korean\nSouth Korean\n\u0026hellip;but none for simply \u0026ldquo;Korean\u0026rdquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s politics for you, I suppose.\nIt is still a fun puzzle to code up a solution for though. So, until next week, happy solving!\n","permalink":"https://www.drmarkpowell.com/posts/countries-and-nationalities/","summary":"Here\u0026rsquo;s another great puzzle to code a solution for.\nThis week\u0026rsquo;s puzzle from NPR:\nThis week\u0026rsquo;s challenge is a spinoff of my on-air puzzle.

I couldn’t come up with the solution in a short span today running it only in my head, and I have lots of other things to worry over in my spare cycles this week. That said, I figure why not have fun coding in Swift and solving the puzzle of the week at the same time?\nThis week\u0026rsquo;s puzzle as stated at NPR:\nThis week’s challenge: This week’s challenge comes for Joseph Young, who conducts the blog “Puzzleria!” Let A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, etc. Think of a five-letter word whose letters’ values add up to 51. Now take this word’s last two letters. Add their values. (For example A and C would total 4.) Change these two letters to the single letter of the alphabet that represents their total. (In this case, D.) The result will be a new word that is the opposite of the original. What words are these?\nSome things we can quickly glean from the stated puzzle:\nThe answer is two words that are opposites, one five letters long and the other four. The first three letters of each of the pair of words is the same, so “light” and “dark” would not work. That’ll help us see the correct answer when we find it, though. Time to write some code to automatically compute those point totals!\nFive letter words First, we need to find ourselves a text file containing all the five letter words that we want to test.\nThe free dictionary website has a very convenient list of five letter words that are in the Scrabble dictionary and several others. That’ll do nicely: copy and paste into a text file and we’re ready to read it with actual code and do some processing.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s Swift time After firing up Xcode, here is the quick-fire code that will read in each word from the file and total up its point value:\nfunc doPointTotal() async throws { let fiveUrl = Bundle.main.url(forResource: \u0026#34;five_letter_words\u0026#34;, withExtension: \u0026#34;txt\u0026#34;) let wordLines = fiveUrl!.lines for try await line in wordLines { if line.count != 5 { continue } var pointTotal:UInt8 = 0 for char in line.lowercased() { pointTotal += char.asciiValue! - Character(\u0026#34;a\u0026#34;).asciiValue! + 1 } if pointTotal == 51 { print(line) } } } The URL.lines returns a nice AsyncSequence that we can iterate over using this for try await loop. This will actually interleave the I/O of reading the file with the process, so the content will page in on demand if the file is really large, avoiding the need to wait to read it all first before processing can begin (or crash if there’s not enough memory capacity to read it all!) Three cheers for async/await in Swift!\nAlso, how elegant is that for try await syntax? Eat your heart out and my dust, Python, most popular language in the world!\nOnce we have each word as a String, it’s a simple matter of computing the value of each character and assign “a” as 1, “b” as 2, and so on. If the point total of the word is exactly 51, we print it out.\nNow before we write more code than we really need, let’s run it and see what we get:\navoid\nbroke\ndaily\nLooks like it’s working great! I actually got 14 words from my dictionary file that meet the puzzle criteria, and that narrows it down nicely, (The other words are omitted from this post to avoid spoilers for my fellow puzzle solving fans.)\nThat’s it for this week! Happy coding and puzzle solving.\n","permalink":"https://www.drmarkpowell.com/posts/movie-shmovie/","summary":"Will Shortz himself has often said that however you want to solve the puzzle is fair game.
